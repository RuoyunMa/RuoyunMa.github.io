About me
======

I am currently a junior undergraduate at the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. In my sophomore year, I joined Intelligent Vision Group (IVG) as a research assistant, supervised by [Prof. Jiwen Lu](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/). I also work on machine learning with [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lqiang/) at the University of Texas at Austin.  

My long-term goal is to promote manufacturing automation, and I believe this can be achieved with a combination of machine learning, control theory and optimization. My current research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep neural networks.
